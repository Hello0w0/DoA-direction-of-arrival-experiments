# DoA-direction-of-arrival-experiments
The comprehensive homework of the DSP class, test the performance of MUSIC, ESPRIT and RARE in the DoA(direction of arrival) problem.
the annotations are in Chinese because its my homework :)

## To run the program:
* modify and run `test_MSE.py` to get the MSE of the three algorithm, then run `plot_MSE.py` to plot the results.
* modify and run `test_Resolution.py` to get the resolution of the three algorithm, then run `plot_Resolution.py` to plot the results.
